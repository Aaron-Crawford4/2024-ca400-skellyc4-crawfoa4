## SECTION B

### Introduction

Many note taking applications are needlessly expensive, cannot be accessed on all platforms or have limited functionality. Our project seeks to provide an easy to use note-taking application for web and mobile platforms. The application will enable users to create, modify, organise, and access their notes effortlessly regardless of the platform they are on.
The notes wil be stored in an easy to use text format that allows us to cater for a number of use cases.

### Outline

The proposed project involves developing an online note taking application capable of storing and managing notes. The system will comprise of a backend, git based server and clients for the web and Android platforms. Notes will be written in markdown as we believe it has an easy to learn/use syntax and its features are useful and allow it to fit many use cases.

User will be able to create, edit, view and delete notes through an intuitive ui on both android and web platforms. 
Using git for our backend will make it possible to synchronise the note files across platforms.
