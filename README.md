GitMD is a markdown editor available as a web application and on mobile platforms. The application allows users to create, modify, organise, and access their markdown files effortlessly regardless of the platform they are on. It aims to make the writing process more accessible, shareable and ensure no loss of work through the use of Git. Git repositories allow users to access their files on multiple devices and collaborate with other users on the same markdown files by sharing a repository; these features are ideal for teams working on projects or research groups.
